**Fraudulent Transaction Analysis | SQL & Data Analytics Project**

In this project, I performed an end-to-end analysis of a financial transactions dataset to identify fraud patterns, customer risk levels, and transaction behavior trends. The goal was to clean the data, extract meaningful insights, and build KPIs useful for fraud detection.

** Key Steps Performed**

Data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL

Converted raw datetime fields into clean DATE and TIME columns

Created KPIs such as total transactions, fraud percentage, fraud amount & total amount ,average amount 

Performed monthly, weekly, and hourly transaction trend analysis

Identified top risky customers based on fraud ratio

Executed MoM % change analysis for customers, fraud amounts, and total transactions

Calculated moving averages of transaction amounts for behavior monitoring

** Insights & Analysis**

Calculated fraud percentage, total amount lost, and top 5 high-risk customers

Identified peak fraud hours, fraud-prone devices, and locations with maximum losses

Analyzed transaction trends by weekdays, months, and transaction type

Categorized customers into High / Medium / Low Risk using fraud frequency

Built trend analysis using window functions like LAG(), RANK(), and MOVING AVERAGE of 7 days .

**SQL Concepts Used**

Aggregate Functions(sum,count,avg)

CASE Statements

Date & Time Functions(month(),year(),monthname(),hour()

Window Functions: LAG(), RANK(), AVG() OVER()

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Grouping and Ordering

This project helped me strengthen my SQL expertise and understand real-world fraud detection
